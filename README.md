ðŸ’¡ Assumptions made

1. User can continue game if they call `/validate` with valid ticks and no rule violation, but did not get fruit. These calls will receive 404 but its assumed to leave for the client side to implement the UX. This case shouldn't happen in game, since `/validate` is only called when user reaches the fruit, but ive tested it on backend for fail safe just in case.
2. User cannot 180 degree reverse their move. Based on the usual Snake gameplay, the snake stays at the same position after catching a fruit. However, since the `State` structure does not keep track of the previous round's last velocity, the validation check to prevent 180 degree turn is skipped for all the 1st ticks in the set.

Due to time constrains ðŸ˜…

- Not testing redis interactions
- Not testing extensively for json payload in api tests (Most are unit tested in individual functions)
- Did not separate test environment use of redis with development environment
